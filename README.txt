Hello!

Adrian here,

This is a little project I did trying to imitate Minecraft's world generation algorithms and interaction!
If you're interested check out my other projects over at github.com/Arixdan.

In this one you can play in a small 20*20 chunk world, explore the terrain and caves and remove and place blocks.
Just open the project in Unity and open the scene called MainScene in the Scenes folder.

Have fun!
