Hello!Adrian here,

This is a little project I did trying to imitate Minecraft's world generation algorithms and interaction!
It's features are:

-Random terrain generation
-Cave systems generation
-Ore generation based on height and probability
-Removing and placing Blocks
-Diferent types of blocks depending on the height of each block
-Being able to walk through plants and remove them
-Block updates for changes like removing a plant if there's no block below it
-Mesh optimization using a chunk system

You can play in a small 20*20 chunk world, explore the terrain and caves and remove and place blocks.
Just open the project in Unity and open the scene called MainScene in the Scenes folder.

Have fun!
